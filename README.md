## JS Benchmark

Inspired by [a blog article](http://raganwald.com/2013/03/28/trampolines-in-javascript.html) on using [thunks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk) to achieve tail recursion, I decided to write a function to implement tail recursion in vanilla JS, and then benchmark that against traditional recursion and an iterative implementation of the same code.


These are my results:
```
10,000 iterations of sum_of_terms(3000)
recursive: 12618.739999999998 ms
tail_optimized: 11038.399999999994 ms
iterative: 18.37999999999738 ms

1,000 iterations of sum_of_terms(30,000)
recursive: N/A (stack overflow)
tail_optimized: 11177.24000000002 ms
iterative: 18.360000000015134 ms
```
